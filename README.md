# project-cloud9
A personal development project to automate the provisioning of an AWS Cloud9 IDE.  Overtime, I would like to implement this project using the following tools and technologies:
* [CloudFormation](cloudformation/)
* [Terraform](terraform/)
* [Python](python/)
* Bash
* Go

The repository is for personal use and professional development.
