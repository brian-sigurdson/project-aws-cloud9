# project-cloud9
A personal development project to automate the provisioning of an AWS Cloud9 IDE.  Overtime, I would like to implement this project using the following tools and technologies:
* Cloudformation
* Terraform
* Python
* Go
* Bash

The repository is for personal use and professional development.
